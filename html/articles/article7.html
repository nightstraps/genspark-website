        <h2>The Time Has Come for Western Democracies To Ban WeChat.</h2>

        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>With an adorable logo, Chinese tech conglomerate Tencent’s WeChat comes across as a harmless and user-friendly messaging app. This “innocent” application boasts a monthly active Chinese user base of 806 million people (Source 1) and 2.3 million active users per week in the United States. (Source 3) Whilst the app’s numbers may seem impressive, what certainly isn’t is its <b>record of Chinese government-subsidized and independent censorship of deemed ‘offensive content’ on non-Chinese accounts, of which should give cause to Western democracies to ban the app.</b>b></p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>In the cyber world, app accounts are subject to the laws of the countries in which they were created. Chinese law forces WeChat to censor and scan for anti-CCP (Chinese Communist Party) posts and topics deemed offensive, but Tencent has no legal grounds to do this on accounts of WeChat made outside of China. However, this is exactly what the app has been doing.</p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>A study by researchers at the University of Toronto’s Citizen Lab revealed that “documents and images transmitted entirely among non-China-registered accounts undergo content surveillance wherein these files are analyzed for content that is politically sensitive in China.” (Source 1) This combined with the countless testimonials of WeChat users outside of China being politically silenced raises red flags.</p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>When George Shen from Boston posted a picture commemorating the death of a Chinese political activist on his American WeChat account “within a couple of hours [his account was]… immediately blocked.” (Source 3) Similar alarming stories have been recorded from Canadian users.</p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>In Canada, freedom of speech is protected in the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and in almost all other Western democracies freedom of speech is protected by law. Why then should governments allow an app to be used that has been proven to go against the fundamental freedoms we hold so dear?</p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>Diplomatic efforts to get Tencent to stop its censorship have been hardly successful, partly due to WeChat being under “a great deal of pressure” to implement censorship measures from authorities in Beijing, says Adam Segal, an american cybersecurity expert. (Source 2) This leaves no option other than banning the app. There are many other apps that provide similar functions and services as WeChat and do not censor content. Governments that claim to support the right to free speech should be supporting apps that do not censor its citizens, and not allow ones that do to gain precious market share. </p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>By banning WeChat, apps that do not illegally censor content would get a much needed boost in an ever competitive tech market. Furthermore, this would send a clear signal to Tencent and the Chinese government that freedom of speech is a highly valued commodity in the Western world.</p>
