        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>As the coronavirus pandemic influences the economy; it also influences the housing market. Unemployment rates make for struggles to pay rent and non-lenient landlords cause many Torontonians to face the struggles of homelessness directly for the first time during this pandemic, but just what does that entail?</p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>Pictures of pop-up restaurants building <a href="https://nowtoronto.com/food-and-drink/bubble-dining-toronto-restaurants-dome-igloo-winter">outdoor dining pods</a> or people doing <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/yoga-studio-bubbles-toronto-canada-social-distancing-coronavirus-a9584686.html">yoga in bubbles</a> have been rising on social media, but on the less reported side, this is the same city that’s taking down small <a href="https://www.ctvnews.ca/canada/city-of-toronto-threatens-to-remove-tiny-shelters-built-to-help-the-homeless-citing-safety-concerns-1.5205109">shelters built by community members</a> advocating for homeless people living in tents. Though it is understandable that the municipal law says that you’re not allowed to build on city property, this seems to suggest the value of property over the lives of people. </p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>It’s no surprise that the practice of taking down <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/moss-park-eviction-encampment-1.5657363">homeless encampments</a>> have been happening for years in the city, but recently there’s been a greater struggle for homeless shelters to accommodate the number of people coming to their doorsteps.</p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>There’s been an inadequate amount of space to welcome more people, especially considering social distancing attempts with COVID-19. Because of this, homelessness activists have sued the City of Toronto for failing to provide the <a href="https://globalnews.ca/news/6871095/toronto-homelessness-lawsuit-covid-19/">promised 2 meters</a>> of distance between occupants, relative to a settled agreement back on May 15th, 2020.</p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>The lawsuit claimed to be in breach of Section 7 of the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/canadian-heritage/services/how-rights-protected/guide-canadian-charter-rights-freedoms.html">Charter of Rights and Freedoms</a> stating “Everyone has the right to life, liberty and security of the person and the right not to be thereof except in the principles of fundamental justice.”</p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>A number of petitions have been going around suggesting the usage of unoccupied hotels and stadiums such as the Scotiabank Arena to provide shelter to homeless people to make up for the lack of space in shelters. These petitions have been spread around social media advocating and raising awareness about the adversities that homeless people in Toronto regularly face. </p>
        <p class="bold words">Statistics (VIA City of Toronto):</p>
        <p class="italic words">25 temporary shelter and hotel programs for physical distancing have come into effect since March 2020, making 2 300 spaces.</p>
        <p class="italic words">Over 900 people moved from encampments into safe indoor spaces in shelters and hotel programs</p>
        <p class="italic words">Opened City-operated facilities with showers, washrooms, and drinking water for individuals experiencing homelessness</p>
