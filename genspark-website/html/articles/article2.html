        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>The year 2020 has been quite a rollercoaster. It is a year for the scrapbooks, that is, if you even
            have any photo memories to put in it. Since the global pandemic started, people have started to
            go crazy. Everyone’s lives have taken a turn for worse or for better, that is for you to decide.
            According to the Centre of Addiction and Mental Health (CAMH) in Canada, people’s stress and
            anxiety levels have risen dramatically as fear for their health and overall well being clouds their
            minds. More specifically, students are struggling to tackle an online school schedule while
            adjusting to a whole new lifestyle.</p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>During this time of isolation, many of us feel scared, angry, frustrated, sad, and simply alone.</p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>You may feel scared of the unknown. Sadly, we can’t all be as brave as Elsa and charge into
            the unknown with positivity.</p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>You may feel angry or frustrated with this virus, which is so tiny and yet so powerful. Who knew
            something so micro could cause this much chaos?</p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>You may feel sad because the usual joys in life that you look forward to are being taken from
            you. Things such as eating in your favourite restaurants, going shopping with friends, going to
            recreational parks and museums, or even just travelling somewhere for vacation. These are just
            a few of the things that have been put on a halt this year.</p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>You may feel extremely lonely during this time where you are made to self isolate in order to
            protect yourself and others. Humans are social creatures. We thrive on social interactions.
            Covid-19 managed to find the kryptonite of the human race and toy with our minds and
            emotional sanity.</p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>Times are tough and this virus does not seem to be going down without a fight. But, we aren’t
            going to give up either. In a short amount of time, adapting to this new lifestyle doesn’t seem so
            bad. Sure, it may not be something we are used to, but that is like all things that change.
            Change is something hard to cope with. Some cope better than others. It is our choice whether
            we will continue to be a punching bag and let this virus beat us down, or step up, get out of bed
            and make the most of it.</p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>So, instead of wallowing in sorrow with negativity, make the most of this new year with a new
            attitude. Start off the day with positivity and say to yourself “today is going to be a good day!”
            From there, you can remove the thoughts of all things that you can’t do anymore out of your
            mind and make a list of all the things you CAN do. Also, take a moment to count your blessings
            and be thankful for all good things in life, either big or small. Find ways to make someone else’s
            day a little brighter too. A simple few words of encouragement to your fellow family, friends,
            teachers, neighbours etc. may seem like a small gesture, but not insignificant. Physically, we
            may be vulnerable against the attack of the virus, but that doesn’t mean our mental and
            emotional guard should be let down too. We’re all in this together.</p>
