        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>“If you haven’t come out of quarantine with either a skill, starting what you’ve been putting off, or more knowledge, you didn’t ever lack the time, you lacked the discipline” reads a motivational tweet by Jeremy Haynes that went viral this past April.</p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>Back during the first lockdown in April, everyone was a baker. Bread makers were sold out everywhere, and social media was crowded with people posting their new whole wheat hobby. If not bread, social media feeds were brimming with posts about finding a newfound sense of fulfillment through extensive work out plans or redecorating; it seemed like just about everyone and their mothers were on a productivity kick.</p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>This excessive push for efficiently using time, coined as hyper-productivity, consumed explore pages, and has once again surged with the emergence of 2021. The “new year new me” mantra accompanied by the pressure of hyper-productivity during the pandemic is a deathly combo. While this content can be interpreted as motivational, it can also be overwhelming. The pressure to adopt new hobbies and improve oneself during time at home has become anxiety inducing for those who haven’t met the picture of productivity that social media expects, in fear of feeling ashamed. As 97% of teens are on social media, this overload of hyper-productive content is impacting them most out of any subgroup.</p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>For many teens, life during lockdown lacks engaged learning and human connection, leaving a gap of social interaction that many fill with social media. Most rely on the numbing feeling that comes with scrolling through an explore page, as a distraction from emotions surrounding the unknowns of the pandemic. A side effect of using social media as a coping mechanism for these feelings, is that it separates us from nuanced human emotions that need to be expressed. Suppressing sentiments towards the new reality harms mental health, and blurs the line between social media’s purpose, shifting it towards a form of comfort rather than entertainment. With no possibility for a social life to serve as a distraction during the pandemic, and with the constant reminder to be productive hanging over our heads, teens wind up feeling lost and incompetent.</p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>How to stay productive during quarantine has racked up over a million results on google, evidently revealing that our generation is easily swayed by the false realities of social media. Social media tells us, “I’m not affected by this pandemic because I’ve been productive like never before; online shopping, working out and polishing a new skill”. It makes us wonder…should I be doing that too? Slowly but surely, we become conditioned to assume hyper-productivity is the key to happiness; that “seizing the moment” when the opportunity presents itself is the default. We’ve forgotten how to comfortably sit with ourselves and have replaced it with an obsessive, workaholic culture.</p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>It is not necessary to hold yourself to such high standards during this time. It’s valid to be doubtful, feel unmotivated, and tired. Becoming a cheese connoisseur or reading War and Peace can wait for a time without the judgy eyes of social media hovering over your shoulder. Remember that this illusion of hyper-productivity on social media is just a facade.</p>
