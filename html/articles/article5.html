        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>Amongst a seemingly endless bombardment of bad news and numbers, many students nowadays find themselves entrenched in anxiety and a fear for what’s to come.</p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>As a student myself, I know these feelings all too well. Family and friends feel distant, an unneeded layer of aggravation has been added onto school and overall, getting any peace of mind has simply become that much more challenging. It also doesn’t help that, try as they might, sometimes parents just can’t understand.</p>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>What you should know however, is that there are plenty of useful approaches you can easily take to help you overcome the effects the COVID-19 pandemic may be having on your life.</p>
        <b class="words">1. Practicing Proactivity</b>
        <p class="words"><span class="tab"></span>If you’re in grade 9 or above, chances are you’ve heard the term ‘proactivity’ thrown around before. In essence, being proactive means taking control of your situation and steering it in the direction that best suits whatever it is you’re trying to achieve. This can make drastic positive impacts on a person’s life and can actually help manage stress levels too. As Professor Thomas S. Bateman, specialist and teacher of organizational behaviour at the University of Virginia puts it, “knowing proaction’s power to achieve results and personal well-being, you can focus it on changing yourself or changing things outside yourself.  You can target your own behaviors—for example, strengthening your leadership tactics or work habits—or your job performance, overall health, or job stress” (Bateman). For students, engaging in proactive decision making can look like a variety of different things.</p>
        <p class="words">Some examples could include;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Going to bed a little bit earlier everyday to be more prepared for school in the morning.</li>
            <li>Keeping a concise and organized agenda of responsibilities or tasks to stay on top of due dates.</li>
            <li>Reviewing past tests and assignments regularly and marking down concepts that still need to be worked on to ensure success later on.</li>
            <li>Asking for help - conferencing with teachers or professors when you’re stuck or struggling.</li>
            <li>Trying to become as engaged in class as possible to absorb content easier and faster.</li>
