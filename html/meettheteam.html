            <span class="tab"></span>It only takes one spark to ignite the flame in this generation
            for positive change and influence in the world. GenSpark is
            a news awareness website geared towards helping youth find clarity
            in the world they live in. 
        </p>

        <p class="text">
            <span class="tab"></span>The content in current news and media
            may be challenging for youth to personally relate to. It often
            portrays senseless content that can be very confusing to understand
            for younger generations. GenSpark articles are written by teens,
            for teens to help the youth today relate to everyday world events.
            GenSpark’s purpose is a safe space for youth to creatively express
            their thoughts and emotions about events that are happening in the
            world. Our goal is to create a community among youth where they
            feel accepted in knowing that they are not going through trials in
            life alone.The more awareness and exposure to real world events,
            the more accepting we can be of others, to better the world we
            live in.
